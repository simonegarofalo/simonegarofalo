          Hello and welcome to my little space on the web.
          </p>
          <p>
          I'm an Italian junior developer and I love talking about Computer Science as much as I love programming.
          </p>
          <p>
          I built this place driven by the need to express my thoughts about my life and my passions.
          </p>
          <p>
          Here I can write whatever I want without the ambition to impress you or the fear of being judged.
          </p>
          <p>
          At the same time, I chose to write my posts in English, instead of my native language, to practice - and maybe improve - my writing skills.
          </p>
          <p>
          Before you start looking around, I invite you to read the short excerpt below. This introduction comes from a book that I loved.
          </p>
          <p>
          This is actually my vision of programming. I hope that you find it interesting.

          <i>"Writing computer software is one of the purest creative activities in the history of the human race. 
          Programmers aren't bound by practical limitations such as the laws of physics; we can create exciting 
          virtual worlds with behaviors that could never exist in the real world. 
          Programming doesn't require great physical skill or coordination, like ballet or basketball. 
          All programming requires is a creative mind and the ability to organize your thoughts. 
          If you can visualize a system, you can probably implement it in a computer program."<br /><br />
